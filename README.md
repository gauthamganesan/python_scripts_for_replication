# python_scripts_for_replication
functions used in a model building pipeline - built in  python
This repository will contain functions that I use everyday around building models.
Feature Engineering techniques I have used, Model evaluation techniques that are not commonplace, etc..
Anything and everything that I find merits turning into a function will be updated here, with a small description of what it is 
and where it is useful...
